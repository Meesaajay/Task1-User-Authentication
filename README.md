# Task 1 - Secure User Authentication

This task is about creating a simple login user interface using React.

The login page has a typewriter effect at the top where it shows the text "Welcome Back!" one letter at a time. Below that, there's a form with email and password fields.

After the user enters the email and password and clicks login, the data is sent to the backend using an API call. If the login is successful, a popup appears saying "Login successful."

The background has a smooth gradient color which gives a clean and modern look. The whole UI is centered both vertically and horizontally.

At the bottom of the login box, there is a small watermark text that says "Made by Ajay" to show ownership of the design.

This completes Task 1.
